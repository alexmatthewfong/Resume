# Resume Example
This repository has a reusable template. To use the template visit [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) or your favorite LaTeX editor and copy both the .cls and .tex files to a new project. Everything in this template is customizable and should be relatively simple to figure out. 

To easily rotate positions or experience to tailor your resume to specific job applications, simply surround the text to be commented out as such:
\iffalse
Text to be commented out
\fi
